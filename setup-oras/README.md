# Usage

This action installs [oras-cli](https://github.com/oras-project/oras) in the runner. Only needed in the self-hosted runners without oras-cli installed.

## Versions

To know more about how this action is versioned, read the monorepo [README](../README.md#versions).

## Example

Example of usage in a component repository:

```yaml
steps:
  - id: setup-oras
    name: Setup oras
    uses: Telefonica/cross-platform-actions/setup-oras@{BRANCH_NAME|VERSION}
    with:
      version: '1.0.0'
```

## Inputs

- `version` - Version of oras-cli to install

## Outputs

- `oras-path` - Path where oras has been installed

## Debug mode

To enable the debug mode add a repository variable named `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG` and set its value to `true`. Debug mode is more verbose and it shows the response of the requests done to the github API.

# Development

## Requirements

Read the monorepo [README](../README.md#requirements) to know the requirements of this project.

## Branching model

This repository uses the trunk-based development branching model. The `main` branch is the main branch (surprise! üòú), and it must be always deployable. All the changes are done in feature branches, and they are merged into `main` using pull requests.

> Note: Even when the main branch should be always deployable, before [declaring a formal release](#release) it may be necessary to perform some manual steps, like updating the changelog or the version number. So, it is recommended to use a release branch to prepare the release.

## Installation

Read the monorepo [README](../README.md#development) to know how to install the monorepo dependencies, which automatically installs the dependencies of this package too.

## Lint

Read the monorepo [README](../README.md#development) to know how to run the linter in the whole monorepo.

## Check spelling

Read the monorepo [README](../README.md#development) to know how to check spelling in the whole monorepo.

## Check types

This project uses [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). You can check types with:

```sh
pnpm nx check:types
```

## Unit tests

Unit tests are written with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/). To run them, execute:

```sh
pnpm nx test
```

The coverage report will be generated in the `coverage` folder.

## Build

‚ö†Ô∏è __IMPORTANT__: For the moment, the project has to be built locally on every change, and the `dist` folder has to be committed to the repository. This is something that we will improve in the future. But, for now, there is a step in the test workflow that checks that the `dist` folder is up to date. So, remember to build the project before pushing your changes, otherwise the tests will fail.

To build the project and add the dist folder, execute:

```sh
pnpm nx build

# Remember to add the built files!!
git add dist
```

## Component tests

Component tests are executed in a real environment, using the GitHub Actions Runner.

## Release

Read the monorepo [README](../README.md#release) to know how to release the monorepo, which automatically releases a new version of this action too.
