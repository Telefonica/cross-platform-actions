      "username": "my-username",
      "password": "my-password"
    }
  }

```

  },
  "dns": [

    "dev.scaffold.com"
  ]
}
```

## Debug mode

To enable the debug mode add a repository variable named `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG` and set its value to `true`. Debug mode is more verbose and it shows the response of the requests done to the github API.

# Development

## Requirements

No dependencies. Coded as a composite action with inline JavaScript.

## Branching model

This repository uses the trunk-based development branching model. The `main` branch is the main branch (surprise! ðŸ˜œ), and it must be always deployable. All the changes are done in feature branches, and they are merged into `main` using pull requests.

> Note: Even when the main branch should be always deployable, before [declaring a formal release](#release) it may be necessary to perform some manual steps, like updating the changelog or the version number. So, it is recommended to use a release branch to prepare the release.

## Release

Read the monorepo [README](../README.md#release) to know how to release the monorepo, which automatically releases a new version of this action too.
