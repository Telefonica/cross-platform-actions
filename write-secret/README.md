# Usage

This action receives a secret name, secret value, a list of repositories and an optional environment, and updates the secret at repository or environment scope (if present) with given value.

__So, you can use this action in the a project's repository to update secrets in a list of repositories or environments. Such as deploy manifest information.__

1. The project's deploy workflow launches this write env secret action.
2. This action updates the secret in the given repositories or environments.
3. The secret is available in the repositories or environments.

## Assumptions

- The project information is a JSON string with following schema:
  - `repositories`: Array of repository name (including owner).
- :warning: Both repositories and environments (if environment input is present) **MUST** exist before this action is called. If not, the action will fail.
- :warning: The given token **MUST** has access to repositories, environments and secrets scopes. For more information, read the [Github documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/actions#secrets).
- The output manifest contains the Github Secret names for each repository, in the same order as the input repositories. It contains following schema
  ```jsonc
  {
    "github": {
      "secrets": [
        {
          "repository": "<repository including owner>",
          "secret": "<secret name>",
          "environment": "<environment name>" // if present
        },
        // ...
      ]
    }
  }
  ```

## Versions

To know more about how this action is versioned, read the monorepo [README](../README.md#versions).

## Example

Example of usage in a component repository:

```yaml
steps:
  - id: deploy-platform
    name: Deploy execution platform
    uses: Telefonica/cross-platform-actions/deploy-platform@{BRANCH_NAME|VERSION}
    with:
      project: $PROJECT_NAME
      environment: $ENVIRONMENT_NAME
      token: $TOKEN
  - id: write-secret
    name: Write environment secret
    uses: Telefonica/cross-platform-actions/write-secret@{BRANCH_NAME|VERSION}
    with:
      secret: IDP_DEPLOY_MANIFEST
      value: ${{ steps.deploy-platform.outputs.manifest }}
      repositories: |
        [
          "Telefonica/repository-1",
          "Telefonica/repository-2"
        ]
      env: int
      token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

## Inputs

- `secret` - Name of the Github Secret to sync the secret to.
- `value` - Value of the Github Secret to sync the secret to.
- `repositories` - List of repositories as a JSON string.
- `token` - Github token to get access to the repository workflows
- `environment` - Environment name to be used in the deploy secret.

## Outputs

- `manifest` - Manifest with information of the updated secrets by repository, as a JSON string.

## Debug mode

To enable the debug mode add a repository variable named `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG` and set its value to `true`. Debug mode is more verbose and it shows the response of the requests done to the github API.

# Development

## Requirements

Read the monorepo [README](../README.md#requirements) to know the requirements of this project.

## Branching model

This repository uses the trunk-based development branching model. The `main` branch is the main branch (surprise! üòú), and it must be always deployable. All the changes are done in feature branches, and they are merged into `main` using pull requests.

> Note: Even when the main branch should be always deployable, before [declaring a formal release](#release) it may be necessary to perform some manual steps, like updating the changelog or the version number. So, it is recommended to use a release branch to prepare the release.

## Installation

Read the monorepo [README](../README.md#development) to know how to install the monorepo dependencies, which automatically installs the dependencies of this package too.

## Lint

Read the monorepo [README](../README.md#development) to know how to run the linter in the whole monorepo.

## Check spelling

Read the monorepo [README](../README.md#development) to know how to check spelling in the whole monorepo.

## Check types

This project uses [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). You can check types with:

```sh
pnpm nx check:types
```

## Unit tests

Unit tests are written with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/). To run them, execute:

```sh
pnpm nx test
```

The coverage report will be generated in the `coverage` folder.

## Build

‚ö†Ô∏è __IMPORTANT__: For the moment, the project has to be built locally on every change, and the `dist` folder has to be committed to the repository. This is something that we will improve in the future. But, for now, there is a step in the test workflow that checks that the `dist` folder is up to date. So, remember to build the project before pushing your changes, otherwise the tests will fail.

To build the project and add the dist folder, execute:

```sh
pnpm nx build

# Remember to add the built files!!
git add dist
```

## Component tests

Component tests are executed in a real environment, using the GitHub Actions Runner. The action is executed in the workflow, and it dispatches the `deploy-test.yml` workflow in this same repository. The `deploy-test.yml` workflow is a simple workflow that just uploads a fake manifest. The component tests check that the manifest is correctly downloaded by the action and passed as an output.

## Release

Read the monorepo [README](../README.md#release) to know how to release the monorepo, which automatically releases a new version of this action too.
